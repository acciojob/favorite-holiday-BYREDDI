Climate (if any) is the only serious deterrent which might spoil your travel plans to Ooty. But regarding climate too, Ooty has something different to offer all throughout the year. The summer is perhaps the best time to visit the place, if you are planning to visit all the tourist spots, including some adventurous treks and hand gliding.</pre></p>
